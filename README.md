# Oasis-Infobyte-Java-Development-Internship

Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship repository! üåê This repository showcases three exciting Java projects that I developed during the internship using Visual Studio Code.

## ATM Interface üèß

The ATM Interface project simulates a basic ATM functionality where users can perform operations like viewing transactions history, withdrawing money, depositing money, and transferring funds. The project showcases my understanding of file handling, user authentication, and object-oriented programming.

**Features:**
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- Secure user authentication based on user ID and PIN.
- Transaction history management with file handling for user accounts.
- Modular design for easy scalability.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Java installed.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Compile and run the `ATMInterface.java` file.

## Number Guessing Game üé≤

The Number Guessing Game project is an interactive GUI-based game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides hints and tracks the user's score based on their attempts. It demonstrates my proficiency in GUI programming, event handling, and game logic implementation.

**Features:**
- Engaging GUI with background and image integration.
- Dynamically generated random numbers for guessing.
- Scoring system based on the user's attempts.
- Responsive feedback and hints for an enjoyable gaming experience.

**How to Run:**
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run the `NumberGuessingGameGUI.java` file.

## Online Examination üìö

The Online Examination project is a Java-based application for conducting online exams with a user-friendly graphical interface.

**Features:**
- Allows users to log in with a username and password.
- Implements a timer for the exam duration, ensuring timely completion.
- Presents multiple-choice questions for the exam.
- Enables users to save questions for later review.
- Displays the user's score upon completing the exam.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile and run the OnlineExam.java file using your preferred Java IDE or command line.

## Additional Notes:

- **Technologies Used:** Java, Swing (for GUI)
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code
- **Challenges Faced:** Overcoming file handling complexities, implementing a secure authentication system, refining GUI components for better user experience.
